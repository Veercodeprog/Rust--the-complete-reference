// type coercion also called as type casting is coercing primitive types that can be performed by
// as keyword
// as conversions can be chained
//When casting to an unsigned integer type T in Rust,the value is adjusted by adding or subtracting
// one more than the maximum value that can be represented in T i.e. T::MAX + 1
//Using unsafe methods can lead to undefined behavior.
//
// example:
// for u8 , u8::MAX = 255
// this means u8::MAX + 1 = 256
// so if we take 1000 as u8
// then 1000 as u8 = 1000 - 256 = 744
// so 1000 as u8 = 744 which is still not in the range of u8
// then again 744 - 256 = 488
// 488 is not in the range of u8
// 488 - 256 = 232
// 232 is in the range of u8
// answer is 232
//
// eg 2: -1 as u8
// -1 as u8 = -1 + 256 = 255
// -1 as u8 = 255
//
// convert by as:
//
// Rust provides no implicit conversion between primitive types , but explicit type conversion can
// be performed using the as keyword.

// DON'T remove any code
fn main() {
    let decimal = 97.123_f32;

    let integer: u8 = decimal as u8; //97

    let c1: char = decimal as u8 as char; // a
    let c2: char = integer as char;

    assert_eq!(integer + 1, 'b' as u8); //b is represented by 98

    println!("Success!");
}

2.ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ By default, overflow will cause compile errors, but we can add an global annotation to suppress these errors.

#[allow(overflowing_literals)]
    fn main() {
    assert_eq!(u8::MAX, 255);
    // The max of `u8` is 255 as shown above.
    // so the below code will cause an overflow error: literal out of range for `u8`.
    // PLEASE looking for clues within compile errors to FIX it.
    // DON'T modify any code in main.
    let v = 1000 as u8;

    println!("Success!");
}

3.ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ When casting any value to an unsigned type T, T::MAX + 1 is added or subtracted until the value
fits into the new type.
#[allow(overflowing_literals)]
fn main() {
    assert_eq!(1000 as u16, 1000);

    assert_eq!(1000 as u8, 232);// 1000 - 256 - 256 - 256 = 232

    // For positive numbers, this is the same as the modulus
    println!("1000 mod 256 is : {}", 1000 % 256);

    assert_eq!(-1_i8 as u8, 255);

    // Since Rust 1.45, the `as` keyword performs a *saturating cast*
    // when casting from float to int. If the floating point value exceeds
    // the upper bound or is less than the lower bound, the returned value
    // will be equal to the bound crossed.
    assert_eq!(300.1_f32 as u8, 255);
    assert_eq!(-100.1_f32 as u8, 0);


    // This behavior incurs a small runtime cost and can be avoided
    // with unsafe methods, however the results might overflow and
    // return **unsound values**. Use these methods wisely:
    unsafe {
        // 300.0 is 44
        println!("300.0 is {}", 300.0_f32.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // -100.0 as u8 is 156
        println!("-100.0 as u8 is {}", (-100.0_f32).to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // nan as u8 is 0
        println!("nan as u8 is {}", f32::NAN.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
    }
}
// do it yourself
// 4.ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
// ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Raw pointers can be converted to memory address (integer) and vice versa.

// FILL in the blanks
fn main() {
    let mut values: [i32; 2] = [1, 2];
    let p1: *mut i32 = values.as_mut_ptr();
    let first_address: usize = p1 __;
    let second_address = first_address + 4; // 4 == std::mem::size_of::<i32>()
    let p2: *mut i32 = second_address __; // p2 points to the 2nd element in values
    unsafe {
        // Add one to the second element
        __
    }

    assert_eq!(values[1], 3);

    println!("Success!");
