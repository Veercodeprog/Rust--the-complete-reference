// type coercion also called as type casting is coercing primitive types that can be performed by
// as keyword
// as conversions can be chained
// when casting to an unsigned integer type T, T::MAX + 1 is added or subtracted until the value
// fits in the new type.
// Using unsafe methods can lead to undefined behavior.:w
